# cachecash
CS 4750 - Database Systems Project

# Incomplete Features
- Admin Y/N on bets to resolve them

    - sort of implemented, currently updates "active" and "result" in bets table
    - no balance or pay updates yet

    - logic to update balances (using DB triggers?)
- Admin views house
- ~~Profile links (from leader board)

# Bugs
- ~~On login to ono-existent account, no error msg
- ~~On account creation, route to log in, not default homepage
- ~~Not logged in & purchase cachecache = 404
- ~~profile balance displays as int not 2 decimal point float
- ~~Balance not reduced after placing bet


# Others
- ~~On friend added, why background no load?
