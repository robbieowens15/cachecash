SHOW CACHE CASH IN ALL ITS GLORY

# Bugs and Incomplete Features
- On login to ono-existent account, no error msg
- On account creation, route to log in, not default homepage
- Games renders strange *Maybe just Robbie's local*
- Not logged in & purchase cachecache = 404
- Games page should display all games, without an applied filter on first press
- profile balance displays as int not 2 decimal point float


# Others
- On friend added, why background no load?
