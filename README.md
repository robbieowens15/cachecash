CS 4750 - Database Systems Final Project

**Purpose**: To create a Sports Betting Book (fake money called *cashcache* ;)) relying on a Relational Database Store
- Provides User Authentication and Profile Page customization
- Ability to place bets on provided games/leagues for *Moneyline*, *Spread*, *Over/Under*
- Ability to follow other users and view their bets
- **Admin** page to manage the games available for betting on
- Leverages *SQL Triggers* to automate pay outs and balancing the book when a bet is placed (pay-in) won/lost (pay-out)
- For user safety, *SQL Check* to user users are 21 years old or older
- In `*.php` code uses `prepare()`, `bindValue()`, and `execute()` to mitigate risk of SQL injection attacks

# Database Design
### Entity Relationship Diagram
**Games**: What can be bet on
**Bets**: A specific bet placed on a game for a specific line by a user
**Accounts**: Users or admin if the boolean field is true
**Posts**: Created by a user to share thoughts about current bets
**Comments**: How users react to each-others posts
**House**: Keeps the books balanced - is the clearing house for wagers and winnings
